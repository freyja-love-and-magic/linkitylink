# Sizes, per App Store Connect's current spec:
#
#   iphone-6.9   1320x2868   the only size an iPhone app is REQUIRED to
#                            supply. App Store Connect scales it down for
#                            every smaller iPhone automatically.
#   iphone-6.5   1284x2778   optional; kept because the folder already
#                            existed and some listings still show it.
#   ipad-13      2064x2752   only relevant if the app ships for iPad.
#                            Linkitylink sets TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY "1"
#                            (iPhone only) in build-ios.cjs, so App Store
#                            Connect won't even offer an iPad slot. Generated
#                            anyway so the set is ready if that changes.
#
# No alpha channel: App Store Connect rejects screenshots with transparency,
# the same rule that applies to the 1024 marketing icon.
