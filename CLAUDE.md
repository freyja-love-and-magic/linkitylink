# Linkitylink - Development Documentation

## Overview

Linkitylink is a Planet Nine native "link-in-bio" app: a user builds one or more cards (name, bio, photo, category, up to 16 links), then publishes a card as a permanent, shareable SVG webpage — a Linktree/Beacons alternative. The primary product today is the Tauri iOS app in `app/`.

This directory also contains an older, separate Express server (`linkitylink.js` at the repo root) that predates the Tauri rewrite and now serves a different purpose — see "Root-level Express server" below. **Do not conflate the two** — they are unrelated codebases sharing one repo.

**Location (Tauri app)**: `/linkitylink/app/`
**Identifier**: `com.freyja.linkitylink`
**Stack**: Tauri 2 (Rust core in `src-tauri/`, vanilla JS/HTML/CSS frontend in `src/`), targeting iOS.
**Status**: Actively developed (commits through August 2026; TestFlight builds up to build 11 in `app/builds/v0.1.0/`).

## Architecture (Tauri app)

### Frontend (`app/src/`)

Three files, no framework or bundler:
- `index.html` — four views as sibling `<section>`s toggled via a `hidden` attribute: `cards-view` (grid of up to 4 cards), `edit-view`, `card-view`, `profile-view`.
- `main.js` (~975 lines) — all view logic, calling into the Rust backend via `core.invoke(...)`.
- `style.css` — dark/green/purple visual language shared across the Planet Nine app family.

### Backend (`app/src-tauri/src/lib.rs`, ~1275 lines)

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `get_categories` | Returns the shared business-category taxonomy (same slug/label list as idothis/bizbuz, copy-pasted, not a shared crate) |
| `load_cards` / `save_card` / `delete_card` | Local multi-card store (`cards.json` in the app data dir; up to `MAX_CARDS = 4`, `MAX_LINKS = 16` per card) |
| `publish_card` | Renders the card to SVG server-side (in Rust) and publishes it to BDO under a per-card sessionless keypair |
| `import_links` | Scrapes an external profile URL (Linktree gets a dedicated JSON-extraction parser; everything else falls back to a generic outbound-`<a>` scraper) and returns candidate links |
| `get_or_create_referral_link` | Publishes (once per install) a static "invite a friend" SVG to its own BDO record and returns the permanent share URL |
| `share_card_to_app_group` | Writes the active card's JSON into the shared iOS App Group under key `linkitylink.card`, so BizBuz can offer "Import from Linkitylink" |
| `import_from_bizbuz` | Reads BizBuz's own shared profile (App Group key `bizbuz.profile`) and maps it into name/bio/photo/links |
| `load_canonical_profile` / `save_canonical_profile` | The cross-app Canonical Profile (see below) |

No server of its own — the app is a thin client over allyabase services, currently pointed at `https://allyabase-gateway-12345.netlify.app/`:
- **BDO** (`GATEWAY_BDO_URL`, `BDO_HASH = "linkitylink-card"`) — publishes each card as its own public record under its own per-card sessionless keypair (BDO's public storage is one slot per pubKey, so multi-card support requires one keypair per card, same pattern BizBuz uses).
- **savage** (`SAVAGE_URL`) — the service that actually serves a published BDO's embedded `svg` field as a live webpage at a pre-signed URL; `share_url` is computed locally (timestamp + signature) the instant `publish_card` returns, no server round trip needed to know the URL.

`GATEWAY_ENV = "test-12345"` namespaces the BDO uuid per card (`bdo_uuid_by_env`) and per referral link, so pointing the app at a different gateway later won't collide with what's already published.

### Card lifecycle

1. **Create/Edit** (`save_card`): local-only, written to `cards.json`. Links and photo never leave the device until publish.
2. **Import**: three ways to fill a card without typing every link by hand — `import_links` (scrape a Linktree/lnk.bio/etc. URL), `import_from_bizbuz` (pull from BizBuz's shared App Group profile, additive only — never overwrites a non-empty field), or the Canonical Profile's own "Fill from My Cards" pull (local-only, in `main.js`).
3. **Publish** (`publish_card`): renders the card as a self-contained SVG in Rust (`render_card_svg` — avatar circle w/ initials or photo, name, wrapped bio, one link row per entry with an auto-detected platform icon badge for ~30 recognized domains from Simple Icons/Font Awesome), embeds it as the `svg` field on the BDO record, and publishes/updates that record. Runs automatically in the background on every app launch (`backgroundPublishAllCards`) and after every save — there is no separate "did you remember to re-publish" step.
4. **Share**: `share-sheet|share_text` (native iOS share sheet) with the pre-signed savage URL, or copy-to-clipboard from the card view.

### Canonical Profile (shared across apps)

A third, independent record — separate from `cards`/`cards.json` entirely — synced via the **`group.freyja.idothis`** iOS App Group, matching the pattern used by BizBuz, Gelder, Gettit, and Letemcook. Read/written through `tauri_plugin_app_group`'s `read_value_sync`/`write_value_sync` under the key `canonical.profile`. `save_canonical_profile` always carries forward whatever `address` is already stored (this app has no UI for it — Gettit does) rather than clobbering it with `None`, since every app that touches the record overwrites the whole thing on save. This logic is intentionally copy-pasted byte-for-byte across the sibling apps rather than shared as a library.

Linkitylink additionally participates in two narrower, app-to-app (not group-wide) handoffs via the same App Group plugin, both one-directional:
- `share_card_to_app_group` writes the currently-saved card to key `linkitylink.card` (BizBuz reads this for its own "Import from Linkitylink").
- `import_from_bizbuz` reads BizBuz's own key, `bizbuz.profile`.

### Cross-promo

Saving a card whose category is food-related (`caterer`, `restauranteur`, `chef`, `food_cart`, `baker`) prompts (once ever, per card id, tracked in `localStorage`) to also list the business on **letemcook** via the `letemcook://add-location?name=...&bio=...` deep link.

### Unrelated to allyabase's Glyphenge proxy route

allyabase's own `CLAUDE.md` documents a wiki proxy alias `/plugin/allyabase/linkitylink/* → glyphenge:3010`. That is unrelated to this app — Glyphenge is allyabase's own server-side SVG-rendering microservice, and the alias exists only because it shares a name with the "linkitylink" product concept. Nothing in this Tauri app or the root Express server talks to that proxy route.

## Build & Deploy (Tauri app)

`app/package.json` scripts:
- `npm run dev` — `tauri dev`
- `npm run build` — desktop `tauri build`
- `npm run build:ios` — `scripts/build-ios.cjs`, the real distribution path (produces a signed IPA)
- `npm run ios:dev` / `npm run android:dev` / `npm run android:build` — also available, though iOS is the active target (`tauri.conf.json`'s window is a fixed phone size, and `build-ios.cjs` locks `TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY` to iPhone only)

### `scripts/build-ios.cjs`

1. Bumps `.build-number` (App Store Connect rejects re-uploading the same `CFBundleVersion`).
2. Wipes and regenerates `src-tauri/gen/apple/` via `tauri ios init` — a clean slate every time, so several things get patched back in immediately after since they don't survive regeneration:
   - `ios-native/` source path added to `project.yml` (carries `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`, the App Group UserDefaults usage declaration).
   - `TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY` restricted to iPhone only (the app's UI is a fixed phone-sized window, not designed for iPad, and building universal would also require iPad screenshots for App Store submission).
   - `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption: false` — skips the encryption questionnaire on every upload (app only ever speaks HTTPS).
   - Real app icon (`src-tauri/icons/ios/*.png`) re-copied over `tauri ios init`'s stock icon, then every icon's alpha channel is flattened via `magick` (App Store rejects an alpha channel on the 1024×1024 marketing icon).
   - App Group entitlement (`group.freyja.idothis`) rewritten into `linkitylink_iOS.entitlements`, which `tauri ios init` otherwise regenerates as an empty `<dict/>`.
3. `tauri ios build --export-method app-store-connect --build-number <n>`, with a manual `xcodebuild -exportArchive` fallback for a known Xcode 26 quirk where Tauri's export sometimes fails even though the archive built fine. Before attempting the manual fallback, the script checks the keychain for an actual Apple Distribution signing identity and bails loudly if only a Development identity is present (rather than silently producing a wrongly-signed IPA that fails at upload with a confusing error).
4. Copies the resulting IPA to `app/builds/v{version}/{ProductName}-{buildNumber}.ipa`.

Upload to App Store Connect is a deliberately separate, manual step (Transporter.app or `xcrun altool`) — the script never uploads anything itself.

### Native plugins

Two local Tauri plugins live under `app/src-tauri/`, both thin Swift/Rust wrappers with no business logic:
- **`tauri-plugin-app-group`** — `read_value_sync`/`write_value_sync` against the shared iOS App Group `group.freyja.idothis` (UserDefaults-backed). Used for both the cross-app Canonical Profile and the narrower BizBuz handoff.
- **`tauri-plugin-share-sheet`** — wraps `UIActivityViewController` so `share_text` can invoke the native iOS share sheet from JS (`plugin:share-sheet|share_text`). Linkitylink is the only sibling app observed with this plugin alongside `tauri-plugin-app-group`, since sharing a public link is core to what this app does (BizBuz/Gelder/etc. don't need a system share sheet for their primary flows the same way).

`bdo-rs` (the Rust BDO client) is pulled by relative path from `allyabase/deployment/bdo/src/client/rust/bdo-rs` — this app's Cargo.toml assumes the sibling `allyabase` checkout exists at `../../../allyabase` relative to `app/src-tauri/`.

## Root-level Express server (`linkitylink.js`)

A separate, older Node/Express service at the repo root (`linkitylink.js`, `package.json` with `"main": "linkitylink.js"`, `lib/app-handoff.js`, `lib/relevant-bdos-middleware.js`, `public/*.html`, `docker-compose*.yml`, `Dockerfile*`) — **not part of the Tauri app**, and not wired into it in any way. It predates the Tauri rewrite (its own `README.md` still describes it as the current product, with API docs for `POST /create`, emojicode-based viewing, etc., matching what the old version of this file also described) but is **not dead code**: it's still current as of an April 2026 commit (`d9b2d71`, vs. August 2026 for the Tauri app), and it is what the Federated Wiki plugin `wiki-plugin-linkitylink` (in `/Users/zachbabb/Work/planet-nine/third-party/wiki-plugin-linkitylink/`) spawns as a child process under the Service-Bundling Plugin Pattern, proxying `/plugin/linkitylink/*` to it.

This server:
- Runs on port 6010 by default (`PORT` env var), talks to Fount/BDO/Addie over HTTP (`FOUNT_BASE_URL`/`BDO_BASE_URL`/`ADDIE_BASE_URL`), and creates link pages as public BDOs keyed by emojicode rather than the Tauri app's per-card keypair model.
- `lib/relevant-bdos-middleware.js` — Express middleware for the `relevantBDOs`/payee-splitting pattern used by the user-submitted-template creator-economy feature (template creators earn a cut via a payee-quad BDO referenced from the template).
- `lib/app-handoff.js` — a web-to-app handoff flow (authenticate a pending web-created BDO to a native app via a color-sequence game, then hand off the coordinating pubKey) — this is a different, older mechanism than the App Group-based Canonical Profile used by the Tauri app.
- `docker-compose.yml` builds and runs this server as a container alongside a `planetnine/allyabase` image; `docker-compose.standalone.yml`/`Dockerfile.local` are lighter-weight local variants.

For API/integration details of this server (endpoints, environment variables, the template-marketplace / MAGIC-spell revenue-sharing feature), see the wiki plugin's own documentation: `/Users/zachbabb/Work/planet-nine/third-party/wiki-plugin-linkitylink/CLAUDE.md`, and this repo's own `README.md` and `MANUAL-TESTING.md`/`USER-TESTING-GUIDE.md`.

## Known Limitations

- **No real App Store listing yet**: `APP_STORE_URL` in `lib.rs` is a placeholder (`https://apps.apple.com/app/id0000000000`), flagged with a `TODO` to replace once Linkitylink has a real listing — the referral-share feature links there today.
- **Import scraping is best-effort**: `import_links`' generic fallback parser (non-Linktree URLs) is a simple outbound-`<a>` scrape with a same-origin/self-referential-share-widget filter; sites that render their link list via client-side JS won't produce any results (server-side `reqwest` fetch only, no headless browser).
- **Root Express server and Tauri app are fully independent products** sharing a repo and a name — there is no shared data model, shared code, or migration path between a card in the Tauri app and a link page created via the Express server's BDO/emojicode flow.

## Last Updated
September 2, 2026 — Full rewrite. The previous version of this file documented only the root-level Express server (`linkitylink.js`) as if it were the entire project — accurate for that server in isolation (its README/API haven't materially changed), but it predated and never mentioned the Tauri iOS app in `app/`, which is now the actively developed product. This version documents both, and clarifies they are separate, unconnected codebases.
